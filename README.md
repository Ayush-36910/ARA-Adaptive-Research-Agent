## 🚀 Project Overview
**ARA (Adaptive Research Agent)** is an intelligent research assistant designed to combat information overload. Unlike standard bots, ARA uses a **Deep Filtering Mechanism** via Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to accept or reject information based on a specific Focus Topic.

It extracts relevant info from **YouTube Videos, Websites, and PDFs**.

## ✨ Key Features
* **🔍 Deep Topic Filtration:** Rejects irrelevant noise.
* **🔀 Agentic Routing:** Smartly switches between Video, Web, and PDF tools.
* **⚡ Live Research:** Real-time synthesis via Activepieces.

## 🛠️ How to Use the Automation Flow
1. Download the `ARA_Activepieces_Flow.json` file from this repository.
2. Go to [Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/).
3. Create a new flow and click **Import**.
4. Select the JSON file.
5. Add your Google Gemini API Key and YouTube Connection.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
* **Python** (Kaggle Notebook)
* **Activepieces** (Orchestration)
* **Google Gemini 2.5** (Reasoning Engine)
* **Jina AI / Firecrawl** (Web Scraping)
